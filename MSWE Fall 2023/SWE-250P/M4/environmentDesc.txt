To run and test the code: I could test my code using the node.js script written in the previous assignments such as M2.
However, I can also run and test my webpage by using the live server extension from vscode(which basically does the same thing).
After installing live server, select index.html and launch server by pressing "Go Live" on bottom right of IDE. This
essentially is the same if not easier way of running and testing server.

For the most part, I translated my javascript code into typescript. Typescript uses static checking which constantly
checks for data types and errors before runtime. This helps during the development process and catches errors before
compliation. Along with static checking, we of course declare data types in typescript, ensuring that certain attributes
must adhear to specific data types. I also added a script in package.json where "npm start" will run "tsc --watch".
This constantly converts my typescript into javascript code and outputs it to the dest directory specified in tsconfig.json
