I initialized this React project use Vite. To run and test the code: Inside M3, open the terminal and run 
"npm run dev". This fires up the server using npm. After firing up the server, you can simply control click 
on the printed statement "http://localhost:80/" in the terminal. 

For this assignment, we had to implement React. I used modularization to create React modules and had App.jsx act as
the module base. I also implemented a few interfaces for my React modules to ensure that functions adhear to certain
types and fields. Lastly, I used React's use state to keep track of count and update the display.
