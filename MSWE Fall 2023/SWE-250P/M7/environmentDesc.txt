To run and test the code: Go inside tsconfig.json and fill email user and email pass info for both imap and smtp.
The pass should be 2-factor authentication from your gmail and it should be using an app password rather than the
actual password so you will need to create an app password in your gmail. Inside M7, go into mailbag and then the 
server directory, open up the terminal and run "npm run dev" which calls the scripts specified in package.json 
which compiles ts to js code and starts up the server. Go to browser and search "localhost"

New feature added: The old inbox was returning emails in order, but the top begins with newer emails given
that the bottom email is the oldest email in the entire Inbox. I changed it so that it now returns sorted emails, but the top begins 
with the most recent emails. This was implemented in IMAP.ts on line 153.

AJAX enables asynchronous communication between the browser and the server. This means that data can be exchanged 
with the server without reloading the entire web page. Since AJAX allows for partial updates of web pages, users 
experience faster response times and smoother interactions. They don't have to wait for entire pages to reload 
when performing actions like submitting forms or fetching new data. AJAX requests send and receive only the 
necessary data, reducing the amount of data transferred between the client and server. This can lead to a decrease 
in server load and bandwidth usage, making your web application more efficient.
