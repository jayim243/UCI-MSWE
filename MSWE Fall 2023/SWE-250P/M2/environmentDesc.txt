To run and test the code: Inside M2, open the terminal and run "node server.js". This fires up the server using
node.js. After firing up the server, open browser or choice(Google Chrome in my case) and search "localhost" or you
can simply control click on the printed statement "http://localhost:80/" in the terminal. This assignment is just
a static webpage as there is not javascript functionality on it.
